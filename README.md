# CodeSamplesUE
This is a showcase of UE4 a few code samples of the work I've made in the past years 

# The files act as if they formed part of the same project
Read through the files to find their relations and how they use the other 'features' of this project. 
- There is a Game Mode that spawns a Manager Class and allows binding to a generic delegate of itself. 
- There is a CustomActor class that is registered by this Manager Class and can also answer to the delegate of the Game Mode.
- There is a Custom Library that has a few utilities from Sound to Math, and can be accessed from any class easily. The CustomActor does it.
- There is an example of a Header File of the project with it's enumerators, structures, and definitions of Log categories or Macros.
- There is a Custom Module that could be applied externally to the Content in your Project solution (.sln).
